# Stellar-classification-RF
The categorization of stars, galaxies, and quasars based on their spectral properties is a crucial concept in astronomy. 
By dividing stars into different categories based on factors such as their temperature, luminosity, and chemical composition, we can gain insight into their physical properties and evolutionary stages. 
Early cataloging efforts of stars and their positioning in the sky led to the discovery that they were part of our own galaxy, and as telescopes became more advanced, it was determined that other galaxies existed, such as Andromeda, which sparked further study.Â 
The main goal of this project is to  classify stars, galaxies, and quasars according to their spectral properties
In this project I relied on the Stellar classification Dataset - SDSS17
